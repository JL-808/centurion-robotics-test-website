                <h2 style = 'font-size: 27px; font-weight: 500;'>Why Centurion Robotics 22689?</h2>
                <p>Of the more than 8,500 active teams, why should you join Centurion Robotics 22689? Well, here's a detailed breakdown of why we are the best team for you to join in the 2026-27 season.</p>
                <p>Firstly, we are local. Manitoba is significantly unrepresented. As one of only three teams in Manitoba, we ...</p>
                <p>Secondly, we are a veteran team with an already established reputation and sustainability in mind. While more than 30,000 teams has participated in FTC at some time, most of the teams are not sustained enough to stay. 
                    However, Centurion Robotics has sustainability embedded in our team. Founded in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, the team has powered through many challenges and survived a long period of insufficient funding. 
                    Despite the challenges, Centurion Robotics astonishingly grew in size and started to become a close-knitted community. 
                    On January 30, 2026, the Centurion Robotics Team finally gathered enough funds to travel to Calgary to compete in the team's first official FTC competition, and in just one day we took the spotlight of the event. 
                    Featuring an innovative lift system and a versatile outtake that can launch artifacts from anywhere on the field, we were a favorite among the teams. 
                    Ending the day as the finalist alliance captain and the winner of the 3ʳᵈ Place Inspire Award, we have shown our mastery and resilient in FTC.</p>
                <p>Lastly, we are a team with uncapped potential. Having already reached a goal that many teams would never meet in our first attempt, the Centurion Robotics Team has a huge ambition to be even better in the next season. 
                    Following a major rework of the team structure, our team is now even better equiped to face whatever challenges that gets in our way. 
                    Along with the many seasoned members that will remain in Centurion Robotics, we are more than capable to deliver a competition-winning robot in the 2026-27 season.</p>

                <h2 style = 'font-size: 27px; font-weight: 500;'>Our vision for the 2026-27 season</h2>
                <p>With our huge potentials, our ambition is equally as monumental. While an extremely high goal for most FTC teams that competed only once before, our aim for the 2026-27 season is to leave our mark in the FIRST Championship. 
                    There is an enormous task that lay ahead of us, but we believe that with enough effort, this dream will become the reality. 
                    However, we cannot do everything along, which is why we are excited to bring you with us on this incredible journey.</p>
